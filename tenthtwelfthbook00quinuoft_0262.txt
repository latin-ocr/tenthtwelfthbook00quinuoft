3. nec rursus—senectutem answers to neque praepropere,
etc. Neither must the young orator be brought forward prem-
aturely, nor again must he be kept too long in the period of
tiroeinium. audere. Youthful ambition in speech is illus-
trated in the example quoted below from Cicero.

4. pro Sexto Roscio locus. The “passage ’' is from the
speech for Roscius Amerinus, who was charged with parricide.
It is quoted more at length in Orat. 30, 107, where Cicero re-
marks that his maturer judgment disapproved of it as too florid.
cum; concessive. defervisse et liquata, to have worked off
(eeaeed fermentinq)‚ and to have become clear,· a metaphor from
the fermentation and settling os wine. The subJ'ect of the in-
finitives, grammatically ea, is rather talia. The actual words
of Cicero are more definite: quae· nequaquam satie deser-wisse
post aliquanto sentire coepimus,

6. omnia—desiderant; as in the case of Porcius Latro,
x, 5, 18. actionem aqua deficit, the water faite, or oute off
the speech. The reference is to the clepsydra, or water-clock, a
small instrument which timed the speaker by the gradual run-'
ning out of the drops of water, like the saud in an honr-glass.
A certain number of clepsydrae was allowed the speaker in
trials, whether in the senate or in the courts. Plin. Ep. ii, 11,
14: duodecim clepsydris, quas spatiosissimas acceperam, sumt
’ additae quatuor. loquendum. On some occasions we must
give up all rhetorical speaking, and simply talk ‚· and this, 'the
kind of diserti we are here speaking of, the formal declaimers ot
the school-room are entirely ignorant ot (minime sciunt).

6. viribus nitentem. Spalding quotes viii, 3, 6: sanquine
et viribus niteat, as showing that the participle here must be
taken from niteo rather than nitor ,· though Buttmann prefers
the latter. et non utique—operam: and even aster this
maiden effort, I would by no means wish him to keep on con-
tinuously with the work of pleading‚ like an old practitioner.
continuare, to continue without interruption. ing-enim dative
aster inducere. adhue alendo, still to be nwrtured; not yet
having attained its full growth. refici atque renovari.
Comp. x, 5, 14, sqq.

⁹7. usus est M. Tullius, etc. Cicero gives an account 01
this passage of his early life in the Brutus, 91, 314-316.
