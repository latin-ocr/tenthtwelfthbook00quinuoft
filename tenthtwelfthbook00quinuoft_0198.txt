124. Cornelius Celsus 3 a voluminous writer of the age ot
Augustus and Tiberius; best known to us by his treatise on
medicine. See also xii, 11, 24. Sextios. There were two
philosophers of this name, father and son, flourishing under
Caesar and Augustus. They were said to have been followers of
Pythagoras, though Seneca, Ep. 64, calls the father a stoic.
Plautus. There is some uncertainty as to the reading; whether
Plautus, or Plancus. G. Rubellius Plautus, a descendant ot
Tiberius, belonged to the stoic school. Owing to the jealousy
os Nero he retii-ed to Asia Minor, where he was murdered by
the emissaries of the emperor in A. D. 62. Catium an Insubrian
Gaul, whom Cicero mentions in a letter, written in Β. c. 45, as
having recently died.

Annaeus Seneca, was born at Cordova (Corduba), in Spain, about
Β. c. 4, and died by the command of Nem, A. n. 65. See Intro-
duction, page 20. in omni genere eloquentiae, in cormeatton
with, or in treatiny os every class of literature. In treating os
the various departments of Roman authorship, I have purposely
reserved my observations on Seneca for the close of the whole
chapter. He might also have been classed with poets or orators.
Accidit; the perfect. dum contendo, while I was striviny,
See H. 467, 4; Ζ. 506. corruptum, etc. See Introduction, page
21. This vicious style is here referred to as that of the times,
and not of Seneca alone: a kind of speaking, or the (prevailing)
atyle of writiny (dicendi yenus).

in teaching; a few years after Seneca's death. excutere, i. e.‚
e manibus adolescentium. illi refers to potioribus, the more com-
mendabte writers ,· those of the Ciceronian period. imitaban-
tur is used here in its first meaning: to copy, represent, resemble,
successfully imitate ,· as in x, 2, 11; 5, 8; xi, 3, 55, et al. In its
other signification: seelciny to resemble, it is also very frequent:
as in x, 2, 7, and 18, et al. The admirers of Seneca did not
imitate him in the first sense, did not, as implied in the next
sentence, make themselves similar to him or nearly so (pares
aaut proximos). tantum, etc. Seneca had been inferior to the
early writers ιη taste and style alone; but his admirere feu be·
low him both in style and matter.
