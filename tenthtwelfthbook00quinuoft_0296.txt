knowledge which he professed (prae se tulit) was as superficial
as general. ita. se praeparavit, he so trained himself. Quin-
tilian seems to have in mind the passage in Cic. de Orat. 3, 32:
Eleus Hippias, eum Olympiam venisset, maxima illa quinquen-
nali celebritate ludorum, yloriatus est, cuncta paene audiente
Graecia, nihil esse ulla in arte rerum omnium, quod ispse nesci-
ret, sqq. inlusisse-iubebat. This is to be taken as the
independent statement of the sentence. “ To say nothing of
Homer, whose vast erudition is matter of inference, and os
Hippias, whose claim to universal knowledge rests upon his
own boastful assertions‚ we have the voice of all Greece bearing
testimony to the wonderful attainments os Gorgias.” For the
construction inlusisse Gorqiam Graeciae credimus, see x, 1, 115.
Gorgiam. Gorgias, of Leontini in Sicily, an illustrious sophist-
and orator, born in the early part of the fifth century B. 0., lived
to be more than a hundred years old, preserving his vigor of
mind and body to the end, and thus setting at naught all the
ills that extreme old age is subject to (inlusisse tot malis, eta).-
His views on philosophy and oratory are embodied in Plato's
“Gorgias” qui—quaerere. Cic. de Orat. 3, 32: isque (Gor-
gias) princeps ex omnibus ausus est in conventu poscere qua de
re quisque vellet audire ‚· cui tantus honor habitus est a Graecia,
soli ut ex omnibus Delphis, non inaurata statua, sed aurea

statueretur. This invitation, of course, and the answers and ·

discourses in reply to questions thus elieited, were proos to all
Greece of the variety and genuineness of his learning. The
passage does not very distinctly say what it seems to mean3 that
Gorgias lived to extreme old age, always to the last acquiring,
and always imparting knowledge; as we are assured by the ac-
counts of his readiness to discourse on all possible questions
proposed to him* in presence of all Greece assembled at the great
national games. And thus Gorgias is a splendid example os
what can be achieved in life by the proper use of time.

long period, not oenturies, but only a life-time, in attaining so
much knowledge. See x, 1, 83. nobis cognoscenda, by us
