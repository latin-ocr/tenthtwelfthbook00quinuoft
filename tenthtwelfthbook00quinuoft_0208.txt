204 noras x, 3, 5-7.

“nature of things ” in English conveys a different notion-
nascendi, of yeneration. quae fecerit, for she has made.
H. 5173 Z. 564. The quo modo is treated of in the present
and the following chapter; quae maxime scribi oporteat is
reserved for the fifth. iam hinc, literally: from just here,-
simply: now. Some have proposed hune for hinc‚· but iam
hinc, indicating the point of departure, is quite frequent. See
viii, 3, 40; ii, 2, 153 iii, 1, 1; ii, 11, 1‚-et al.

5-18. As to the manner of this exercise ot writing, it should at first be
slow and cautious, with much study ot each successive phrase and sen-
tence3 but gradually accelerated, especially by the student ot oratory;
who can not be fitted for his profession without getting rid of too much
revision and sels-criticism‚ and without acquiring the habit of writing
promptly, naturally, and clearly. But a. degree of haste inconsistent with
logical order and clear expression must be avoided.

6. diligens, accurate. optima, the beet thinys, includes
both ideas and words, as indicated by the words 'rerum and
verborum, below. nec. For non, neque, and nec with the sub-

once ,· join with gaudeamus, not with the participle offerenti-
bus. inventis; the things (words and ideas) which have sug-
gested themselves to us. delectus agendus, choica must
be exeret-sed. So V, 6, 3: ayere curam. ratio conlocandi, the
way, or manner of arranyement. numeri, the composition or
phraseoboyy ,· rhythmical series or groups of words; as in 2, 16.
ut, just aa.

6. scriptorum proxima, what we have last written ,· the
last preceding words or sentences. praeter id quod. See on
1, 28. repetito spatio. By going over the last passage written,
before beginning the next, the writer gets a new impulse, just
like the athlete who goes back some little distance, and by run-
ning over this space to the point of the leap, secures a more
powerful spring. ut conatum longius petant, 80 that they
try to yet a start farther back. For the usage of ut here, see 1,
58. quo, wherein,· the ablative denoting the space in which
the leap is made (contenditur), or which it covers. nervos, the
bowstrtnys.

7. interim. See on 1, 24. dum non. dwm or modo with
non instead of ne is a. usage taken from the poets. Comp. xii,
