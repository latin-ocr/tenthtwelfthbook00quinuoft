Fabricius, Rufinum3 both distinguished in the war against
Pyrrhus. The words here quoted are said by Cicero (de Orat.
ii, 66) to have been addressed by Fabricius to Rufinus himself
on the occasion when the latter had returned thanks to Fabri-
cius for nominating him, though a personal enemy, to the con-
sulship. Rufinus is called by Aulus Gellius (iv, 8), fwrax lwmo
¹ct avaritia acri.

1-9. Above all things (ante omnia), the orator must miltivaoe his
character by the study ot philosophy ; tor natural tendency to goodness
is not enough without instruction ; and as oratore and rhetoricians have

1. virtus—est. A continuation of the protasis, et being
omitted. The sentiment is that of Horace, Ο. 4, 4, 33:
Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborant.
ante omnia: not first of all things in the order 01 time, but as
in x, 1, 3, in importance.

2. seilicet ut confiteantur, so that forsooth (as the neces-
sary result implied in such an opinion) they allow or admit.
contemptissima, the most humble. virtutem vero habea·-
mus; in the same construction as confiteantur, after ut. ”

3. metus—purgaverit. Such fears as the result os corrup-
tion and blindness of mind, need to be removed by the pmifyinq
influence of philosophy. tractatum tractarit3 a remarkable
instance of negligence in an author of such correct habits. We
may translate: has discussed the doctrines. que—que, both-

and,· as in 11, 8. populis et gentibus, etates and natione. ,

The words, however, are often synonymous. eruditiore nex·-
mone, in philosophical diacono-se.
