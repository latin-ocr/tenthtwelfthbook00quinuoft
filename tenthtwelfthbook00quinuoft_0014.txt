10 INTRODUCTION.

iard even then as the peritus I ben* Nor is the tradi-
tion without significance which tells of a Spanish scholar
of Oadiz making a pilgrimage to Rome on purpose to
see the historian Livy.† Such incidents shadow forth
the fact that the literary cultivation of the Romans had
already permeated the Spanish provinces ς and there is
good reason for the remark of Mr. Merivale, that “the
great Iberian Peninsula was more thoroughly Roman—
ized than any other part of the dominions of the repub-
1ic.” Σ

111 return for the boon of civilization, Spain reared a
noble succession of scholars and writers to infuse new
vigor into the thought and the literary life of the mother-
country. As the conquered Italians* two centuries
earlier had given to Roman literature its first impulses,
and had impressed upon the Latinity of the golden age
its characteristic types, so now the provincials of Spain
became the teachers of the great metropolis, and im-
parted to the literature of the silver age all the principal
features of thought and style which distinguished it
from that of the preceding period.

Two of these Spanish authors, the two most widely
known and most universally read, were Seneca, the
younger, and Quintilian. And it is worthy of remark
that with these two illustrious writers originated the two
antagonistic schools or styles of Latinity which were
struggling with each other for pre· eminence during the
latter part of the first century of the empire.

Marcus Fabius Quintilianus was born at Calagurris,
now Calahorra. in the northeastern or Tarraconese

province of Spain, about A. D. 35] It is said, though on
