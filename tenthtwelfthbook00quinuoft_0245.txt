amples of justifiable falsehood in the “ Republie‚’' ii, p. 382, ed.

is an ellipsis of ut sit vetitum mentiri ‚· much less that, ete.

40. nec hoe dico, etc. The following is the interpretation.
given by Boeckh of this troublesome passage: Nor do Ι say
this as if in all cases I would justify on the ground os duty the
act of defending a father, brothersor friend, when placed on
trial (periclitantibus) and really· guilty; for (quia) in general Ι
am in favor in such cases of obeying the laws in all their severity ;
though indeed there may well arise at times in such circum-
stances a doubt as to the path of duty, and some case of this
kind might easily justify deception on the part of the defense;
but let us take an example which shall leave no room for hesita-
tion on the ground of natural affection, or on account os a claim
ot kinship‚ such as to make us ready to excuse even crime com·
mitted in obedience to it; not taking advantage os such an ex-
treme case, Ι will sustain my proposition by examples in which
the question isthe naked one of duty to society or to the in-
dividual citizen. qui—oraton see ξ 1.

41. nonne utemur—simili. ‘⁶ Will it not be right for us,
in such emergencies, to employ the art of oratory in disguising
facts and in supporting untruth‚ somewhat in the same manner
as bad men use it? The art is good indeed in itself and in its
general application, but yet in its method of appealing to the
minds ot men it is similar to the evil devices (malis artibus) of
unscrupulous orators, or to rhetorical methods used for evil
purposes.'’ This interpretation the context seems to require,
though others understand arte. here in a more restricted sense:
am art, a device of oratory, good indeed in the use here contem-
plated, yet kindred to dishonest devices. But this sense of arte
would probably have been expressed by quadam arte dicendi.

42. ad hoe = praeterea. posse, sc: eos. futurum, ie des-
tined to be, will become. cui vera obiciatur, against whom
well yrounded ekaryes shall be presented.

43. advocabit3 in its frequent sense of “ summoning] to the
defense of‚'’ with the dative of the party or person defended.
