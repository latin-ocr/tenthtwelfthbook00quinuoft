222 NOTES. X, 7, 2-4.

‘⁴ Entering a harbor ’' here is, of course, as a pilot. ad quem-
possit is only another way of saying “dangerous”; reached
through an unsase channel. A pilot who offers his services to
steer ships into such a port must have skill and presence of

’ mind, especially in stormy weather or in baffling winds. So an

advocate must have the ability of extemporaneous speech to
meet the sudden change of issues and all emergencies which are
the windings, rocks, and shoals in judicial controversies.

2. repraesentatis iudiciis, trials being suddenly appointed,-

without regard to his written or premeditated speech. He can
not pass by in silence, or ignore such accidents of litigation and
be an orator. Comp. 1, 2, xii, 9, 20. fallunt, disappoint us,
