228 NOTES. X, 7, 24-27.

24. continetur-ars. Art (seience, theory, mles), once un-
derstood remains fixed in the mind (non labitur); even the pen
loses but little by the remission of practice; but this extem-
porary ability, the essential characteristic of which is readiness
for action, is kept up (continetur) by active exercise alone. With
labitur supply ez animo. The sense as used here is sully ex-
pressed in Verg. Ecl. 1, 64: quam nostro illius labatur pectore
voltus. promptum hoc, etc„ translated freely: this attain-
ment which requires readiness and instant aetion: quite liter-

subject. illa, like proxima, refers to the practice of extempore
speaking, either alone or in the presence of others, in which we
are ashamed to stop in order to think of. the most appropriate
ideas and words. contextum dicendi. See on ξ 13. in
alia3 explained by firmitatem, etc„ which are in the same con-
