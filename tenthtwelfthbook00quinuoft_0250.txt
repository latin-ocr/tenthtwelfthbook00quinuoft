the several grounds, states, or issues on which they are argued.
These are of such a nature, and leave so much, aster all, to be
decided by fair or logical inference, or by the wisdom and dis-
cretion of the eourts, that there is almost no case (nulla sere) in
which it is not necessary to have recourse to consideratione of
abstract equity and goodness (tractatus acqui ac boni); and, in-
deed. a multitude (plerasque) of cases, turn wholly upon their
equity or moral quality (in sola qualitate consistant). By coniec-
twra is meant aryument from facts ‚· inference drawn from
“putting together '' or comparing the facts elicited from the
witnesses and the evidence in the case. See iii, 6, 31, 45, vii, 2.
finitionibus concludantur, are determined by definition33 by
the proper names or designations of things 3 the status finitionis.
For instance, is it sacrilege to steal private property from a
temple, or is it merely them See iii, 6, 31, vii, 3, 1. iure sum-
moveantur vel transferantur, are dismissed or left pendinq
on ἱεραὶ yrownds. The reference is to what is called the status
translativus or leyalis; the ground or question of postpone-
mentz an issue of law3 when the suit is alleged to have been
brought against the wrong party, or by an attorney not au-
thorized to conduct it, or before the wrong tribunal, or at an
improper time-3 under the wrong statute, or in an incorrect
form, or involving the wrong penalty. See iii, 6, 52. Cic. de
Invent. 2, 19. alia. configantur, concurrant. ducantur.
Strictly these are three varieties or species subordinate to the
status legalis, just mentioned. Contigere, as in x, 1, 84, is to
argue or inser by syllogism. For example, the law os Tarentum
forbidding the exportation os wool was interpreted to prohibit
also the exportation of sheep. See vii, 8. For it is assumed as
a major premise‚ that any act which necessarily carries with it
the violation of the letter of a law, must itself be virtually in-
cluded in that law. inter se concurrere is to be in mutual con-
flict or antagonism, and is said of laws which are inconsistent
with each other in their tenor; they are leyes contrariae. In
such a case either no decision can be reached, or else the court
for some reason accepts the authority of one of the conflicting
laws in preference to the other. See vii, 7. alia, in this clause,
as the subject of concurrant, becomes a metonymy for aliae
loyes. It is laws themselves, not questions or cases that are in
