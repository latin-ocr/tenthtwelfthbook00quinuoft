This First Greek Book, from its logical se-
quence of subjeets‚ its clearness and conciseness
of statement, and its freedom from unnecessary

ff details, will appeal to both teacher and pupil.

Believing that the true aim of Greek study is the
development of the power to read Greek, the
pupil is introduced at an early stage to practice
in the translation of a continuous text, including
dialogues, fables, and reading exercises.

The book is fully illustrated‚ and contains, in
addition to the reading exercises given in the
body of the book, selections from the Anabasi5‚
Hellenica, Cyropaedia‚ and Memorabilia, an Ap-
pendix containing in compendious form for refer-
ence the rules of euphony and syntax, and the
paradigms of declension and conjugation given in
the regular lessons. Altogether, the book is
complete, concise, interesting, and practical, and
one which teachers can use successfully with any
class of beginners.

Copies sent, prepat'd, on receipt of the price.
