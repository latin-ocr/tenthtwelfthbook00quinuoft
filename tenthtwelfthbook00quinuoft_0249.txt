separandis3 as for instance, by defining' a crime, and then
pointing out the difference between it and the act in question.
Cic. de Invent. 2, 18: facti ab illa definitione separatio. dis-
tinguendo, in notiny distinctions ,· that is, distinctions in the
senses of the same word or statement. The complete phrase, as
used by Cic. (Brut. 41, Orat. 4, et al) is ambiyua distinyuere‚·

coniectura, etc. In this sect-ion Quintilian has in mind the
necessity of applying the doctrines os moral philosophy to the
kind of oratory called judicial, or. as we now term it, forensia.
See on x, 1, 47. Therefore he mentions in a general way the
variety of forms of cases that come before the courts3 that is,
