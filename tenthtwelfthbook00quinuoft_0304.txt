Tm: DIALOGUES or PLATO contained in this
volume exhibit the moral qualities of Socrates in
their highest manifestationis, and also give some
insight into those intellectual processes by virtue
of which he made an epoch in philosophy. In
addition to the Apology and Crito there has been
included that part of the Phae-do which describes
in detail the last sayings and doings of Socrates.

The Introduction gives a clear and comprehen-
sive outline of the life, character, and philosophy
of Socrates. This historical sketch is followed by
other aids to an understanding of Plato’s dramatic
representation of his great master and by a criti·-
cal analysis of the argument pursued in the
Dialogues.

The Appendix contains a brief account of the
notable manuscripts and editions of Plato’s works
and some of the more important variations in the
text of the Apology‚ the Crito, and the Phaedo,
together with the principal authorities for each
variatl‘on.
