m Pinianus OF m ORATOR AH'EB. RETIRING FROM PUBmc ΗΓΒ

1-4. The orator should give up public speaking before his powers
decline, and thus save himself from being contrasted in his decay with
his tormer sels (oe priorem), and from oompmmising his former renown.

1. consiliis, in oovmcils,· in a general sense, deliberative
assemblies of any kind. contionibus, in popular assemblies.
non quia sit. See on x, 7, 31.

2. scientia. It is not in knowledge and intelligence that
the agad orator is in danger of failing‚ but in accomplishments
that depend upon his physical condition; and this by the com-

the ridicule of some, and the mortification of his old friends.

4-7. Fruits of learning (studiorum fructus) will attend him in his re-
tirement no less than those he has brought forth in his public lite ; for he
will now produce important writings, or interpret the lews (iura reddet),

resorting to his home to the pathway of true eloquence (vere dicendi
viam), and he will probably find this, atter all, the happiest period 01
