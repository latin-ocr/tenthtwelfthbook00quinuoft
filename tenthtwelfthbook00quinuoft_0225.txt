NOTEs. X, ¹7, 1. 221

sinant, forbid. providere, to look for-ward,- to anticipate
what is coming next in order3 as opposed to the foregoing re-
spicientes, lookinq back, and trying to recall our premeditated
ideas· temeritatem, darinq or wichman the plunging into a
speech without any preparation whatever. male cohaeren-
tem, poorly memorized ,· imperfectly held together in the
memory. ,

’7. peius quaeritur retrorsus; literally peius (for the worse)
is adverbial and joined with the impersonal quaeritur,- sreely:
it ie worse to look back. We should be at a greater disadvantage
in going back, as it were, to find the premeditated ideas that we
have torgottem than to give up all thought of them. dum
ina desideramus, while we are at a loss 'for them ,· nameiy,
the things we have prepared by premeditation. si utrumque
quaerendum est, if (or sime) both things require πελείης. The
two things meant by utrumque are, on the one hand, our ill
remembered premeditation or prepared thoughts (commta), and,
on the other, fresh ideas still contained in the subject. There
must be an effort on the part of the speaker to find something
to say either in one or the other of these two things; both alter-
natives alike involve the necessity of seeking; and, if so, it will
be better to look forward, and seek and find (invenire) his mat-
ter in the subject itsels than to go back, as it were, and grope
about for it in his hals-sorgotten train of preconceived thought3
for more new ideas can still be found in the subject than it has

previously suggested. Halm 'adopts utcumque (amy how, in ,

either ease) for utrwmque.
