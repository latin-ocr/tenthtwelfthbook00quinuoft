1-8. The facts of a. case some advocates neglect to study altogether,
and so, not giving any attention to the important point or issue (cardo).
only seek matter for noisy declamation (clamandi); others from vanity
effect to be so overwhelmed with engagements (occupati), that they post-
pone all consultation with the client until a. few hours before the trial, or
even to the bour of the opening in the court—room itselt (inter ipsa sub-
sellia) ; and still others, for the display of their wonderful talent (iactan—
