Yet, in fact, the practice ot speaking is the most important (ante omnia),
as being the essential and characteristic thing in oratory, and as origi·
nally the only one of the three taught by the rhetoricians in their first
attempts at a system or art ot rhetoric (him initium eius artis fuisse,
manifestum est). Afterward, imitation, or reading and hearing, the basis
ot imitation, and finally writing, were also found necessary as prelimi-
nary studies, and were embodied in this art. But the question in entering
upon the present book is, the order of treatment ; and this will not be the
order ot the relative importance of the three ς for, as in all other at idies,
we attain the chief or ultimate object (summa) by starting from suosidi-
ary beginnings (principia), so here, reading and writing will be first
taken up, as the preliminary conditions ot effective speech, and then will
follow the discussion of speaking or declamation, as the more immediate
preparation for public speaking. 'rhus the things which are first in order
(prima) will in the end become relatively unimportant (minima), and
speaking. as the exercise which is permanently essential to success, and
can never be remitted,* will take precedence.

But it must be remembered (verum, etc.) that the object ot the present
book is not to teach the principles or theory ot rhetoric, already fully dis-
cussed in the preceding books, but to point out the exercises by means ot
thch the student can put in practice what he has learned ln theory.

1. haec eloquendi praecepta. The reference is especially
to the rhetorical or stylistic principles taught in the eighth and
ninth books. Comp„ vii, 10, 17, at the end. sicut—ita, as
also zat—ita, sometimes express the relation of “ though—'yet’'
So quemadmodum—sic, 5, 17. cognitioni, here theoretioal
knowledge, as opposed to vim dicendi, or actual orator-icat power.
firma facilitas, an habitual readiness or well-yrwnded habit.
The equivalent in xii, 9, 21 is vires facilitati-3.

2. indiscreta, inseparable. multo stilo, with much labor

of the pen. citra, in the post-Augustam writers, is frequent tor .

eine. fluitabit, will be afloat: mil be vtique, confused,· not
piloted, as it were (carens rectore) *by good examples. Comp.
vii, prooem. 3. in procinctu, in line of battle, or ready for
confliot,· a figure not used by Cicero. If the practice 01 decla-
mation‚ especially extemporary‚ is'not cultivated, so as to keep
the orator always armed and ready for the emergencies os the
sorum, all that he has gained by the use of the pen and the study
of books will be like the useless hoard of a miser (velut clmsis
thesauris incubabit). quae dicenda refers to invention3 quo
modo, to style or expression (elocutio).
