52. Hesiodus. Hesiod of Askra in, Boeotia, lived about
Β. c. 850. His ἔργα καί ἡμέραι, “ Works and Days‚’‘' is a didactic
poem in epic form, or heroic hexameter, as also the θεογονία, or
origin of the gods and the world, a work commonly ascribed to

the same author, though on questionable authority. pars eius;

53. Antimacho. Antimachus of Claros in the dominion of
Colophon, lived about 405 Β. c. His greatest work was entitled
Thebais, or the Thebaid; a voluminous epic narrative of the

poets, both Greek and Roman. grammaticorum. This term
in Latin was applied to learned literary critics‚ such as Aristar-
chus and Aristophanes among the Greeks. and Gnipho and
Hyginus among the Romans. quanto sit aliud, etc. It seems
to be implied here that the Greek critics would have expressed
themselves more accurately‚ if they had called Antimachus next
(proximus) , and not second to Homer. Horace, O. 1, 10, 18-20,
says that nothing exists similar or second to Jupiter, but that
Pallas holds the place of honor next to him (proximos illi tamen
occupavit honores). Thus one may be called proximus, but not
strictly second, who comes nearest to the first, though by a wide
