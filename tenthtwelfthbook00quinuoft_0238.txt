234 NOTES. XI1‚1‚ae. Ι

versiae,'’ i, 1. 1t is adopted by Quintilian in ii, 15, 1. verum—
utique, but by all means ‚· at any rate. id-quod refers to the
following vir bonus (sit). id non eo tantum, this (let him be),
not only for mis reason. Non tantum should regularly be fol-
lowed by sed etiam, introducing the apodosis rerum ipsa, etc.;
but the period is broken by the insertion of the question quid ⁵
de nobis loquor, as a livelier substitute for the proper connectiveS.
The sense seems to be this: Not only would eloquence, is the
bad man could properly be an orator, become a curse, and I
also, as a teaeher of it, an accessory to crime, but to say nothing
of myself, nature, t00‚ would be found an enemy to her own
children in bestowing upon them such a powerful instrument
of mischief.

3-8. But Ι go still further: not only do 1 maintain that none but the
good man has any right (oportere) to be an orator (political and judiam).
but that none other in fact can become such (futurum) ς none other ean
effectively accomplish the proper work ot the orator3 for. first, the bad
man can not be intelligent and prudent ; second, the corrupt mind whfle
it has no affinity with noble studies, at the same time, distr-acted by evil
passions and aims, has no power to concentrate itselt upon a severe study
such as that of eloquence ; and, again. by lust and luxury it is unnerved
tor labor, while it ean neither have any laudable ambition nor that love
ot iustice and equity which is essential to the true orator.

3. cum—induantur, since they are involved, entwnyled ,-
followed regularly in this sense by in and the accusative.

4. sapientibus dicitur. It was the sentiment of the
Socratic school that the bad man was necessarily a foolish man.
For the dative of· the agent in the later prose writers, see Z.
419, note. ,

5. etiam, ete. Even the ordinary cares and the innocent
pursuits of private life, though free from reproach (culpa caren-
tibus), are incompatible with the severe and persistent study
necessary to perfect oratory; much more the distractions os a
vicious mind and life.

6. huic—rei perit, is lost to this occupation. cupiditatem;
here anthinon, as in Pliny, Panegyr. 7. impotentissime.
impotens (se. sui) is very frequent in the sense of wnqooernabk,
unbridled. somnos—et illa—visa perturbant, disturb our
&lumbers and (breed) those niyhtmaree; occasion restless slum·
bers and those fearful dreams.
