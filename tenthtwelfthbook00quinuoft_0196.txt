age of Cicero. He was the first Roman, says Cicero (Brut. 152),
who applied dialectics to the discussion of legal questions. He
published only three speeches. Cassius Severus; the most
talented advocate of the latter partos the Augustan age. He
was banished to the island of Seriphos, and died there Α. D. 34.
Tacitus (Dial. 19) describes him as an orator of. remarkable gifts,

keeping with the transformed tastes of the Romans, which he
was the first to comprehend and to satisfy. Vidit namque oum

audience is not always a prooi of the orator’s wit; but is often
due to mere bitterness of invective, and coarse and rough‚ or
droll terms of abuse. Comp. vi, 3, 7. ·
