288 NOTES. ΧΠ, 11, 5-8.

monumenta rerum, recorda of events, historica,- ree as in
x, 1, 95. in libris Ciceronis. De Orat. 1, 42, 190. But Quin-
tilian forgets that Crassus in the passage referred to proposes to
write a treatise (artem) on law, not to give counsel or instruction
(iura quaerentibus reddere). praeceptis, maxims, wasone,- as
in x, 1, 523 j0in with dignum, not dabit. os dabit, will utter
speech. ·
5. more veterum. See on x, 5, 19. Also Cic. de Senect.
8, 9. flatibus3 ablative of time. ratio, the “relation,'’ the
occasion or circmnatancea, is Spalding's emendation for the old
reading ratis. humanitatis officio, the duty ofphilamthropy;
humanitas, as mostly with Quintilian, in the sense of ‘⁴ the good
will of man toward men.’' The difference between the Latin
term in this sense and the Greek φιλανθρωπία is that the former
leaves the object, and the latter the subject of the feeling to be
understood. ⁷

6. Caelium—Cicero profitetur. See Cic. pro Cael. 4.
Pansam, Hirtium, Dolabellam. See Cic. Ep. ad Famil. 9,
16, where, however, mention is made only of Hirtius and Dola-
bella by name. In an aneedote introduced by our author in
viii, 3, 54 (Spalding’s text), Pansa appears in a similar relation
to Cicero.

¹7. neseio—fore; grammatical order: nescio an oporteat
fore eum credi. secretus et consecratum closely connected
in sense3 set apart and sanctefled; no longer in contact with
the profane strifes and ambitions of the forum, but devoted to

, the sacred pursuits of learning and instruction: sacra littera«-

rwm colentis (x, 1, 92).

' em. THE CONGLUSION.

8-9. 'rhough the author to the best of his modest ability (quantum
mediocritate valuit) has now embodied in this treatlse all the knowledge
ot the subject acquired in his professione} life and all that he has been
able to leam by investigation (inquirere) in the progress ot the work, he
tear-s that even those who accept all that he has laid down as essentlal
conditione ot perfect oratory, will be deteri-ed from undertaking ι task
seemlngly so formidable.

8. que—que: εει-εκ as in ii, 5, ’7, et al. inquiren-0, in-
vestiqate, ascertain.
