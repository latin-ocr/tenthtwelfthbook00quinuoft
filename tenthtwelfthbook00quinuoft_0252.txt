law questions the habit of referring particular cases to universal
principles. Uomp. x, 5, 12, 13. The meaning, fully expressed,
seems to be this: As every general question is more comprehen-
sive than a special one, and the part is necessarily comprised in
the whole, and is carried by the whole, the orator can have no
real power, breadth, and freedom in speech without the habit of

pensable to the orator on account of its power to exalt the tone and spirit
ot his eloquence, furnishing him with rich material for reflection in the
phenomena of Nature ; and so its study is countenanced by the example
of Pericles, Demosthenes, and Cicero.
