vthus combined after q may be either ua, ue, ui, uo, or ινα.

ior the letter itself. in clausulis, at the ende (of words).

32. innituntur, terminale in,· “ lean,'' as it were, or fall
Iorward upon. sed ost—subiciendo, but moreover by annexiny

ε, (though) itself aleo am unmusioal (letter), to the letter b in the>

preposition (ab). So d of the preposition ad, was generally
omitted in certain compounds; as in aeto and aspicio.

33. similitudine, monotony; want of the pleasing variety
of the Greek system of accentuation. acuta, fiexa, as acuted,
as circumflexed; in the nominative agreeing with syllaba.
These adjectives in the feminine may have been used with an
ellipsis of vocalis or else of προσωδία (aecem), as suggested by Cap-
peronier in his note on i, 5, 23, or of vox, which Cicero uses for
τόνος or nocent in Orat. 18; and so they may be taken here, with
some, in the ablative (acuta προσωδίᾳ, etc.); but such an ellipsis
lacks authority. However, with excitatur and circumducitur
we may translate: the final syllable is never raised with the
acute aecem nor lengthened out with the circumflexe. The accent
is a tone or pitch of sound, high or low, not mere stre-33 of voice.

ἤθη,- to convey their meaning by circumlocution. etiam in
iis—revolvit. Even in regard to obJ'ects which are actually
named, or for which we actually have names (denominata sunt),
our lack of variety or richness of synonyms (paupertas) con-
tinually brings us back to the same words again. ling-uarum
copia, a rich variety of dialect8,· dialectic idioms.

85-39. This disadvantage of the Latin language must be compensaoed
in Roman eloquence by ingenuity and power ot thought, and by rhetori-
cal ornament,
