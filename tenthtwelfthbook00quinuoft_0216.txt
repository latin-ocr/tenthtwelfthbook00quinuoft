Cicero praecipit. In his account of his own education, Brut.
310, Cicero says that he practioed declaiming in Greek iu order
to acquire the habit of expressing himself with like propriety in
Latin3 also in the beginning os ‘⁶ de Officiis ” and “ de Finibus ”
he speaks of the advantage of studying Greek in connection with
Latin; but in no existing passage of his writings is the exercise
of translation expressly enjoined. See Cic. de Off. 1. and de
Fin. 2, sq. Platonis, Xenophontis. Cicero translated the
