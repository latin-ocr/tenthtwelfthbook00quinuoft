20. atque ego, etc. The general sense os the passage seems
to be this: And yet, what Ι have here said may appear incon-
sistent with my remark in the second book, where Ι advised the
toacher to exercise his pupils in other directions as well as in
those for which they might have a natural bent3 and this, be-

own, which would be a more difficult task. But what 1 now
say is only a qualification of that former remark, and not a
contradiction of it. For while the discreet teacher will in gen·
eral try to develop his pupils in a symmetrical way, even such a
teacher will not go so far in this effort as to insist upon that
(laborare in eo) which he finds absolutely repugnant to their
naturas Such would be the clashing of the tenue inqenium
with the fortia et abrupta, etc„ just spoken ot. atque, and yet,-
