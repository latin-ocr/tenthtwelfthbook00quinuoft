168 noras. x, 1, 4¹7, 48.

in simpliciam· strictly, the quality of being literal (proprius),
unfigurative, plain. Comp. §g 6 and 11; 5, 8, et al. supera-
verit3 potential. laetus, ornate, exuberant ,· a metaphor for a
rich, flowery, and beautiful style; the qenus nitidum ,· opposed
to pressus, pruned, trimmed down, concise ,· kindred in meaning
here to its use as a metaphor for richness os vegetation, as in
Verg, Georg. 1, 74; 3, 3853 and for the good condition of well-
sed cattle, id. Aen. 3, 220. iucundus, spriyhtlffi lively ,· pleas-
iny, ayreeable, entertainin9; relieving the description of stern
conflict with passages of entertaining narrative, and occasionally
even of playfulness and humor. gravis, serious.

47. laudibus, exhortationibus, consolationibus. Eulo-
gistic, hortatory‚ and consolatory addresses pertain to the non·
practicaL or epideictic kind of speeehes. Our author will not
dwell upon Homer's excellence in this class, but pass on to his
admirable fitness for study with reference to forensic and legis·
lative debates (litium ac consiliorum). artes3 arta in a good
sense; all the oratorical methods properly employed in lawsuits
and in deliberative assemblies.

48. adfectus, feelinys, affections,· here, and generally in
Quintilian, both those which are emotional and powerful (eone
citati), as anger, terror, grief3 and the mild, gentle, quiet (mi-
tes, oompositz), as benevoleme, friendship, piety. The latter
class, as being in general an habitual and characteristic eondi-
tion οἰ individual minda the Greeks called ἧθος; the former, ou
the contrary, is for the most part occasional, and more positive,
and therefore called πάθος, passion. Quintilian says of ἦθος (vi,
2, 8), that the Roman language has no name for it. Therefore
the term adfectus, though it signifies a positive influencing or
impelling of the soul, and strictly corresponds only to πάθος, is
applied by usage to both of these classes of feeling, or conditions
of mind. They are treated of in vi, 2, 8, sqq. Comp. also ἓ 73,
101. utriusque operis3 that is, of the Iliad and Odyssey.
Horace, A. P. 140, sqq., quotes the opening verses of the latter
as a model exordium. benevolum, etc.; iv, 1, 5: causa prin·
cipit· (inm-assus) nulla alia est quam ut auditorem, quo sit nobis in
ceteris partibus accommodatior, praeparemus. Id fieri tribus
maxime rebus constat, si benevolum, attentum, docilem feceri-
mus. intentum. iv, i, 33: plerumque attentum iudicem facit.
