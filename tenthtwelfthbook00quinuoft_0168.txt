37-42. In laying out a plan of reading tor the present purpose, our
author can not be expected to notice individually (persequi singulos) all
the writers in both languages ; though it is his judgment in general (iudi-
cii summa) that almost all writers, whether old (qui vetustatem pertu-
lerunt) or new, are worth reading, at least in part 3 but the present obJect
is to read what is profitable for the formation ot style (ad faciendam
phrasin), and not that which is valuable 111 relation to some branch ot
hnowledge (quidquid αα aliquam partem scientiae pertinet).

37. persequi singulos, to notice all individuaHy: to go
through the whole line of authors one by one.

38. omnibus aetatis suae qui tum vivebant, includes
only the orators of his own times, who were then living ‚· that is,
all of his contemporaries who were living at the time os the
writing of the Brutus, B. c. 46. In the Brutus, 65, 231, Cicero
says: quoniam in hoc sermone statui neminem eorum, qui vive-
rent, nominare, . . . eos, qui iam sunt mortui, nominabo. Ac-
cordingly he gives a very minute account of the orators of his
own times who have passed away, but of his liviny contempo-
raries he mentions none but Caesar and Marcellus. In the case
os these two he makes an exception in compliance with the re-
quest of Brutus. See Brut. 71, 248. For the usual reading,
quibuscum vivebat, which is conjectural, and has been adopted
from the Aldine edition, Ι have substituted qui tum vivebant,
one of the proposed emendations given in the margin of Halm’s
text. The manuscripts here are entirely at varianoe, and quite
unintelligible. Aetatis suae, taken by itself, would embrace
either the whole career of Cicero as an orator, about thirty-five
years, to the time here spoken of, or else his life. from the time
when he began to hear the orators of the forum as a student (B. ο.
90), a period of forty-four years. Brut. 88, 303: hoo (Horten-

39. apud Livium. This letter of the historian Livy is
also referred to in ii, 5, 20, and probably in viii, 2, 18.
