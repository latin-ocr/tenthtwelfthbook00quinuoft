Quintilian. The other is the elegant treatise entitled
Dialoqus de Oratoribus, usually published with the
works of Tacitus, and now generally conceded by critics
to be from the pen of, that author.* sse only work be-
sides the Institutions known to have been published by
Quintilian is alluded to by our author himself in several
passages of the Institutions, and its subject is indicated
in the prooemium of the sixth book and in the follow-

speakers, But the book of Quintilian is a practical
guide for the young man who is ‚passing through the
course of preliminary traim'ng for public life. It gath-
ers up within comparatively nari-ow limits, and adapts
to the purposes of instruction, the principles and doc-

Tacitus, where the difference between the style of the “Dia-
logue ’' and that os the other works of Tacitus is satisfactorily
accounted for.

passage by Capperonier.
