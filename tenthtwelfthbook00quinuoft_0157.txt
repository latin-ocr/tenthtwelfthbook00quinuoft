BOOK X.

How TO ATTAIN READINESS AND POWER m
SPEECH. .

Tun Tenth Book treats of the studies and exercises necessary
to the actual possession and ready command of the elements of
good oratory described in the preceding books, These exercises
must supplement theoretical knowledge (comitio). They are
mainly three: readiny, um’tiny, and declamation. But with
reading is naturally associated, also, hear-irim· and in these two
the aim is partly the command of diction (copia verborum), and
partly the imitation of good qualities in general. Writing in-
volves the consideration ot method, emendation, and form ‚· and
declamation may be prepared by writiny, or premeditatwm or
may be purely extemporary. Hence, the book is divided into
seven chapters: the first on readinq, including also hearing, the
second on imitation, as an appendix to the first, the third on the
manner of unaing, the fourth on emendation, the fifth on the
material and form of writing, the sixth on premedae'tation, and
the seventh (last in order, though first in importance) on extem·
porary deolamation.

question ot little practica! importance, since all three are Indispensable.
