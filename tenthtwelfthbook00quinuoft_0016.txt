tutions, that the orator should withdraw from public
life before he begins to be inferior to himself, * he re-

years later he was appointed by Domitian instructor of

Though Quintilian had been so fortunate 1n his pro-

misfortunes of life. At the beginning of the sixth book
of the Institutions he speaks of the loss of his wife, who
had died young, and of the recent death of his two sons,
both of whom had given high promise. We leam from
this passage that the elder and last surviving of these
sons died when the work was already nearly half com-
pleted‚ and indeed that it had been undertaken partly
with reference to his education. But, like Cicero, he
sought in literary labor a solace for affliction. Alluding
to Cicero‘ 8 example, he says· Credendum doctissimis
hominibus qui unicum adversorum solatium literas
putaverunt. †

died about the year-1⁵13 of our era, at the beginning of
the reign of Hadrian.

of them bearing any resemblance to the writings of
