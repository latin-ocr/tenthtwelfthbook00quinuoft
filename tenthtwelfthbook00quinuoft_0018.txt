14 INTRODUOTION.

trines widely diffused through the rhetorical writings of
Aristotle, Theophrastus, Dionysius, Cicero, Caecilius,
and many others. A didactic treatise like this must be
characterized by simplicity of method, precision of state-
ment, and fullness of detail. It must not presuppose in
the reader, as do the finest works of Cicero, a high de-
gree of culture in philosophy and letters already at-
tained. In the Institutions‚ therefore, we shall not look
for that originality,* that breadth, that freedom of di-
gression, and that noble negligence which distinguish
the de Oratore, the Brutus and the Orator. But in its
kind the book of Quintilian yet seeks an equal.

It aims to present a proper idea of the responsibility
and dignity of the orator’ s work. It assumes the maxim
of the elder Cato, that an orator in the Roman sense, a

speaker who would persuade the Roman Senate or the ¹

Roman courts, must be not only a master of speech, but
also a good man: vir bonus dicendi peritus.† The
preparation it proposes for this high office commences
almost from the cradle. It takes into view the moral
and intellectual discipline of the child as well as that of
the youth, and upon this earlier training of the nursery
and the elementary school it rears the more immediate
and technical education of the professional school and
the forum. It unfolds in a distinct and practical man-
ner every principle pertaining either to the matter or to
the form of oratory, and sets forth every rule of conduct
essential to success and reputation.

The Institutions are comprised in twelve books.
They were published about A. D. 95. The whole work is
commonly entitled de Institutione Oratoria Libri oeii.‡
