nores, ΧΠ, 1, 21, 22. 237

21. etz—perfectus. -There are different interpretations os
this passage. lt may be paraphrased thus: I have said that
Cicero, humanly speaking. was a perfect orator, and that no
one has come nearer to absolute perfectiori. But even is I
thought otherwise, 'is Ι thought him still less perfect than I do,
I should be at liberty (licebat), and I should have no sear to
maintain this (id defendere) more boldly even than what I have
already said; for 1 have the example of Antony asserting that
he had never seen one that could properly be called eloquens,
even in a limited sense; which was saying so much less in
praise (quod tanto minua erat), so much more in disparagement
of all orators, than 1 should say ot Cicero, even if I should put
him still lower than 1 do. For he is certainly eloquens, no matter
how imperfect. Cicero also himself says that he seeks in vain his
ideal among actual orators. May 1 not then venture to say that
something more perfect may come to light in the eternity still
before us? quaerit, seeks (in vain). Comp. 11, 2, x, 2, 28.

22. transeo illos; because their hypercritical severity is
not worthy of our attention. dormitare. See x, 1, 24, and
note. qui—reprehendunt. The allusion may be to the
strictures ot Calvus and Brutus on Cicero, mentioned in the
Dialogue de Orat. 18: legisti-3 utique et Calvi et Bruti ad
Ciceronem missa-3 epistolae, ex quibus facite est deprehendere
. . . Ciceronem a Calvo mate audivisse tamquam solutum et
enervem, α Bruto autem, ut ipsiu-s verbis utar, tamquam fractum
atque elumbem. compositionem, the structure of hia per-toas,-
that is, with reference to harmony. apud ipsum, in his own
presence, as it were; or to hia faee,· because expressed in
letters addressed to him personally. apud is thus used in xi,
1, 21: in epistolis aliquando familiariter apud amieos dicit.
Cicero. also, Ep. ad Atticum, 14, 20, mentions a letter ot Brutus
disapproving of his ideas of style and “composition‚'’ as pre-
sented in the “Orator.” Asinio utrique3 that is, the father
and son. The former is mentioned in x, 1, 113. His unjust
criticism of Cicero is referred to in the “ Suasoriae '⁹ of the elder
Seneca, 6. The son lived under Augustus and Tiberius, and
was put to death by the latter. He wrote a critical review of
the eloquence of his father, comparing it with that of Cicero,
and giving it the preference.
