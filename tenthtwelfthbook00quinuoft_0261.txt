CHAPTER VI.

. 'nm PROPER. ΑΘΕ ΤΟ BEGIN PUBLIQ spuma.

1-7. The public career of the advocate should not commenee too
early nor be deferred too long ς tor in the former case he would be likely
tolose the modesty of youth, and to preJ'udioe his reputation by a crude
(acerbum) and immature style ot speech, while contracting also a con-
tempt for study (operis); and in the latter, he might become too much
flxed in hIs habits ot seclusimi to stand up with confidence and treedom
before a public audience. Every one should begin at the time most fitting
tor himself individually, and so attain a gradual, natural, and healthtul
growth in his profession.

1. Demosthenem. At eighteen he argued his cause against
his guardian& actiones pupillares habuisse, made pleae ae a
ward. Calvus, Caesar, Pollio. The fact is mentioned in the
‘⁶ Dialogue on Orators‚’' 34, where Caesar at the age of twenty-
wne is said to have arraigned Dolabella, Pollio at twenty-two
Gaius Cato, and Calvus, when a little older, Vatinius; and
all in speeches, the author continues, quas hodieque eum admi-
ratione leyimus. quaestoriam aetatem. The minimum of
age for the candidate when vot-ed for seems to have been thirty
in the republican times and twenty-five under the emperors.
Cicero served when thirty-one, Agricola when twenty-six. See
Cic. Brutus, 92, 318, where it is stated that Cicero was quaestor
in the year of the consulship of Cotta (Β. c. 75), and Tacit. Agr.
6, where Tacitus says that Agricola was quaestor under Salvius
Titianus proconsul of Asia (A. D. 63). pro rostris3 not in front
os, but on the rostra. pro is often thus used of a position on
the front part of an elevated place; as Tacit. Hist. 1, 29: pro
9radibus; and id. 36: pro vallo.

2. destringatur frons. destringere frondem is literally
to strip or pluok off the leasaye os trees. So Columella, 11, 2,
83: olivam manu destringere. stringere is used by Vergil in
the same sense in Ecl. 9, 61: ayricolae strinyunt fronde-s. et
continues the negative force of neque and may be rendered
“while” contemptus operis, contempt of study; as being
something for drudges and not for genius. So in ii, 4. 16:
him . . . contemptus operis et inverecunda fron-s . . . et adro-
yam de ee persuasio.
