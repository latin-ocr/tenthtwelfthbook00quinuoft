I'NTRODUOT'ION.

 

MOST of the representative writers of the so-called
silver age were natives of Spain, though some of them
were probably descendants of Roman colonists. Cor-
dova gave'birth to the two ‘¹‘ Senecas and Lucan. Pom-
ponius Mela was from Cingitera, Martia] from Bilbilis,
Columella from Gades, and QuintiJian from Calagurris.
That so many distinguished authors, each at that period
first in his class, should make their appearance in a
country but just now peopled with warlike barbarians,
indicates a change in national character and pursuits ’
such as only Roman conquerors and Roman laws could

iards, though the most obstinate of all the foreign tribes
ever encountered by the Roman armies, a'nd the most

difficult to subdue, were, after their subjugation, imbued Ἰ

was not without reason that the poet spoke of the Span-

post-Augustam or silver age, as his writings were published in
the reign of Tiberius, though he also fiourished'as a teacher
under Augustus.
