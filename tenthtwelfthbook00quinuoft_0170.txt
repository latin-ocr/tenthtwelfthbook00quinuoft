This one right kind, not like the reeens et tammum, overwrought
with prinkish ornament, and calling away the attention from
the substance to the form, but always aiming to convey the
thought in the clearest and most effective manner, the kind
which is true to nature, is termed in ii, 5, 11, sermo rectus et

seeundum naturam enuntiatus, and in ix, 3, 3, ,simplem rectwmque
loquendi yenus. It had been brought to great perfectiori by the

Greeks, and by Cicero and some of his contemporaries. See

Introduction, p. 19. Though termed here a yenus, it is itselt ⁷

divided into three kinds, also called yeuera .· 1, the simple, teme,
concise, almost conversational (tenue, subtile, presswm, quod
minimum ab usu quotidiano recedit); 2, the grand, broad,
lofty, stirring‚ passionate (yramde, amplum. elatum, comitatmnn
3, the flowing, plastic, polished, smooth, melodicus, intermediate
(lene, nitidum, suave, compositmn, medium). See xii, 10, 58.
Cicero (Orat. 5, 20), referring to these three kinds, says tria sumt
omniuo yenera dicendi, quibus in sinyulis quidam floruerwnt,
peraeque autem, id quod volumus, perpauci in omnibus. In the
judgment of Quintilian Cicero fully attained his desire of excel-
lence in all three. See ἓ 108. pressa, eoquaet, sententious:

superfluity of words, terse. demum, as often, in the sense of
only,· implying that some conclusion has been reached as the
only thing that remains to be accepted after every alternative
has been considered. vere Attica putant. These take an
altogether too narrow view of what is embraced in the term
Attic; for it comprehends the best examples of all three yenera.
Quintilian protests against this misrepresentation of the Attic
school in xii, 10, 21, sqq.; and Cicero, in the Brutus, 82, 284;
