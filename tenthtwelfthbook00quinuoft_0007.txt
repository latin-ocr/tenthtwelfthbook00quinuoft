PREFACE *To THE sncoâ€˜ND EDITION.

 

SINOE the appearance of the first edition of my
Quintilian in 1865, a very thorough revision of
the entire text of the Institutions has been made
by Oarl Halm, and published by B. G. Teubner
at Leipsic in 18683 and new and valuable help
has been contributed to the interpretation of the
tenth book by G. T. A. Kriiger, in his commen-
tary on that book, the second edition of which
was published at Leipsic by the same house in
1874. The text of the present edition of the tenth
and twelfth books has been revised *with careful
reference to the changes introduced by Halm,
and such changes have been adopted where they
are well authorized, or where, in cases of doubt-
ful authority, they seemed to yield a more satis-
factory meaning. Much assistance has also been
derived, in the preparation of the notes of the
tenth book, from the excellent and scholarly edi-
tion of Kriiger. On the twelfth book no new
commentary has appeared. V
