68. quinque constituerunt sonos, etc. The Greek sys-
tem of tones embraced two octaves; as, for example, from O to
<I The five sounds specified here are the extremes of these two
octavos, C, c, E, and their intervening fourths (f, T). Conse-
quently each octave consists of two large intervals, a. fourth and
a fifth, from C to f and f to c in the first notave, and from c to ·
f and fto'c‘ in the second. These large intervals are meant by
the words spatia illa nervorum. The octaves are completed
by the introduction of the other “sounds‚” or tones and semi-
tones of the diatonic scale ; and thus is produced manifold
variety (plmma varietas), not so much in the absolute ⁴number
of the tones of these two octaves, as in the infinite number of
melodia combinations of which they are susceptible. But be·
tween these (his) diatonic tones which they have thus added to
the five primal ones, musicians introduce (in-semi) also the
chromatio and enharmonio lesser divisions of the tone, so that
those few primal intervals (transitus. spatia), only four in num·
ber, include many degrees or gradations of sound.
