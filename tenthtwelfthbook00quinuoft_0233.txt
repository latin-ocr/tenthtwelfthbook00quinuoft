Quintilian, it is questionable here. The passage referred to in
Cicero is quoted only in substance. Quintilian has in mind the
remark addressed to Brutus in the Orator, 10, 34: quantum illud
est, quod in maa-imis occupationibus numquam intermittis etu-
dia doctrinae‚· ⁴semper aut ipse scribis aliquid, aut me vocae ad
scribendum. C. Carbo was consul B. c. 120, and the year afterward
was driven to suicide by the prosecution successfully conducted
against him by the young orator Crassus. Cicero, in the Brutus,
27, 103, 105, commends his eloquence and his industry. Cicero

also says that L. Gellius spoke of himself as having been a ’

tent-companion of Carbo. Nothing, however, is known of any
military campaign carried on by Carbo.

in hand. If the advocate has time for writing, ‘that is the best

thing; if there is no opportunity for writing, then he must re- ’

sort to premeditation; but if excluded from both, he should, by
means of the discipline recommended in the present chapter,
always be ready to speak whenever called upon, and able to

serve a client even without writing or premeditation. depren-
sus, taken by surprise. destitutus, deserted.
