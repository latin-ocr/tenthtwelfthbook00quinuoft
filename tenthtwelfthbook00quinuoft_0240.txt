may be called even a perfect orator; though he himself did not think
that the true orator had yet appeared.

14. invidia, censeam likely to be incurred by the answer of
Quintilian, as it will take the ground that Demosthenes and Cicero
were, after all, not absolutely perfect oratorS. mitigandae—
aures, first I must wia their ears ,· I must persuade these question-
ers to think better of the moral character of the two great orators.

16. in ulla parte, in any particular. provincia admin-
istrata. Cicero was governor of Cilicia in B. ο. 51. repudia-
tus vigintiviratus. Caesar’s agrarian law (Β. c. 59) provided
that twenty commissioners should be appointed to superintend
the distribution of Campanian lands, contemplated in the law3
but Cicero declined the place offered to him on this commission,
though honorable and likely to be lucrative. See Ep. ad Atti-
cum, 9, 2. declinatus, swayed, turned away ,· that is, by the in-
fluence of Caesar and his followers. optimis—partibus. This
term and also optimi were in common use to denote the party
of the senate, at this time headed by Pompey; at least, they
assumed to be the optimi.

17. non se timidum, etc. The precise words can not be
found in any extant work of Cicero. The sentiment, however,
is expressed by him in several places; as in Ep. ad Familiares,
vi, 21 : itaque eqo, quem tum fortes illi viri et sapientes, Domitii
et Lentuli, timidum esse dicebant (eram plane : timebam enim,
ne evenirent ea, quae acciderent), idem mmo nihil timeo, et ad
omnem eventum paratus sum.

18. sic-quomodo; correlatives, as in x, 2, 25, et al.

19.Ἰ quorum—datur, of which (qualities) none is attributed,
ete. proprie—veritatis; as opposed to communem loquendi
consuetudinem, quaeram. See on x, 2. 28.

20. vix—invenio. See x, 1, 106, sqq. fortasse inven-
turus, thouqh perhaps I may find. For this concise usage of
the participle, see H. 549; Ζ. 639, note. adhuc abscisurum,
he would have still pruned off. He would have still further
chastened the exuberance of his earlier style. See Brut. 91.
and Orat. 107, sq. Comp. also 6, 7. securiore, more undis-
turbed,· that is, by public cares. non maligne crediderim,
not unjustly may I venture to think: in no carping spirit I
would express the belief. summam. See on x, 7, 18.
