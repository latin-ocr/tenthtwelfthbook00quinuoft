NOTES. XII, 3, 6-9. 253

prius est enim. Such a proposition would be absurd3 for
the planning and preparation of campaigns must precede the
active operations of war, and they demand larger capacity and
knowledge than the actual movements ot the battle-field. A
good “ fighting general '’ may manage these latter success-
sully, but he is not necessarily on that account fit to be an
imperator.

6-10. The attainment ot this knowledge is not difficult.

6. certum, established, determine& as opposed to dubiwm.

scripto. The written law, as understood by the Romans, em· .

braces all the enactments of the people and of the senate, and
the edicts of praetors, constitutions of emperors, and the re-
corded opinions of jurists. This is lex, or civil law in its nar·
rower meaning as opposed to mos or mores. See on ξ 1.

7. quae consultorum, etc. The dubia, or questions that
can be adjudicated by no law or prescription, nor by any analogy

purely of definition of tex-ms, or of equity, can therefore be
decided without the aid of a jurist.

8. ab eo dissentiet. On questions of equity, as they do
not come under definite laws, the jurists or lawyers themselves
(ipsi illi) will hold different opinions, and the advocate, there-
fore, must not be surprised, it the jurist (consultus) to whom he
may apply for counsel in an equity case, shall not agree with
him in regard to the treatment of it. quid quisque senserit,
what have been the opinions of all former jurists; that is, their
recorded opinions on certain questions.

9. ad discendum ius declinaverunt, have turned aeide
to the etudy os law ‚· have given up the bar and become learned
in the law, or iurisconsulti. Cicero, pro Murena, 13: itaque
mihi videntur plerique initio multo hoe (opus agendi) maluisse ,-
poetfeum id adsequi non potuissent, istuc (ad discendum ine)
mni delapsi. Ut aiunt in Graecis artzfieibus, eos auloedos esse,
qui citharoedi fieri mm potuerint, sie nonnullos videmus, qui
oratom eradere non potuerunt, eos ad iuris studium devenire.
