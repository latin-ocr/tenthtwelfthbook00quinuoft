HIS convenient manual presents the essentials in ancient
history as a unit in a manner both comprehensible and
interesting to first-year students in secondary schools. It is
prepared on the plan recommended by the Committee of
Seven, and at the same time meets every requirement of the
Regents of the State of New York. It combines in one
volume Greek and Roman history with that of the Eastern
nations, and pays more attention to civilization than to mere
constitutional development.

The paragraph headings are given in the margins, thus
making the text continuous and easy to read. At the end of
each chapter are lists of topics for further research, bibli-
ographies of parallel reading. and references to both ancient
and modern authorities. A special feature is the giving of a
brief list of selected books, not exceeding 825 in eost, and
suitable for a school library. The numerous maps show only
the places mentioned in the text, thus avoiding confusion from
too much detail. The illustrations, although attractive‚ have
been chosen primarily with the purpose of accurately explain«
ing the text.
