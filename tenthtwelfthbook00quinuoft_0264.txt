260 NOTES. XII, 7, 4-7.

as Oatiline. cum propugnatoribus ; for cum factis propuqna-
torum ,· referring to the deeds of military defenders, as contrasted
with the protection afforded by the eloquence of civilians. ob-
sidem—accusationem, to present as a pledye (of loyalty to the
state) the prosecution os bad citizens.

4. Lucullis. The reference is to the brothers Lucius and
Marcus Lucullus, who were associated in the prosecution of
Publius Servilius the Augur about Β. c. 85. See Plutarch’s life
of Lucullus. alter appellatus, alter creditur. The elder
Cato has the traditional appellation of “the wise ’'; the younger
even without the title must be deemed wise, if any one can be.
Seneca holds him up as a typical example os the “sapiens ’' of
the Stoics. See Seneca de Providentia. 3, 7, seqq. ducetur
causa. The orator will determine the question of taking up a
case chiefly by the case itself ; that is, by its own merits.

5. commendantium personis, the pereonal character of
those who commend clients to the good offices of the advocate.
ipsorum-decernam the character of those who are to con-
tend in the suit ‚· the litigants themselves, as contrasted with
their friends the commendantes.

6. etiam iactantius. In assuming to be the champion ot
common people the ambitious orator may be even more eels-
ecekiny than in being forward to defend the powerful. minores,
dignitatem. In the antithesis marked by vel—vel, minores
(persons of the lower class) and diynitatem (rank, hiqh station)
correspond respectively to the foregoing humile-3 and poten-
tibus.

¹7. si aequi iudices sumus3 that is, if I am a fair judge
of what is best. ut non fallamus explains hoc in the form of
a result. Not to mislead the client, nor to allow him to g'o
forward in a wrong and probably disastrous suit, is the best
service the advocate can render him. causis3 the grounds or
reasons for sometimes maintaining untruth as given above in
1, 36, sqq.

8-12. As to the question of* pay tor legal service, only when the ad-
vocate is without the adequate means of living should he accept any
compensation. But in such circumstances it is honorable to receive a
consideration, just as it was proper for Socrates. Zeno. and other philoso-

phers to receive contributions from their disciples; but to bargain tor
payment and to contract tor a part ot the expected proceeds ot lawmitn.
