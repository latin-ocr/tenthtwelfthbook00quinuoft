Bibaculus was born at Cremona s. c. 99. illi refers to iambus.
Though the epmie, or added line interrupte, or breaks in upon
the regular iambic verses which give name to this kind of poem,
that does not diminish its pungency. epodos (ὁ ἐπωδός), as here
used, means the odd or added verse, either iambic dimeter or in
