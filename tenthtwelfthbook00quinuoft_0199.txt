127. foret optandum (nobis). The form implies that the
wish could not have been realized. Senecam infamabat,
brouyht reproach upon Seneca ‚· for they claimed, and were
understood to represent his characteristics, while in fact they
were but feeble imitatore even of the pleasing and brilliant
faults (vitia) which alone had attracted their admiration. With·
out his wonderful gifts of mind they could produce nothing
but caricatures of his peculiar manner, and thus made his school
ridieulous. Their folly was akin to that of the superficial imita·
tors described in 2, 16, sqq.

128. rerum cognitio, knowledge of facts. See g 34.

129. orationes, etc. Besides the moral essays and the
epistles of Seneca, none of his works have been preserved, except-
ing his tragedies and his “Quaestiones Naturales? or treatise

continuous chain, and the predominating characteristic through·
out his works. On this account his writings leave upon us the
impression of an almost unbroken series of coruscations, inter-
esting, indeed, on account ot their fullness of meaning; but
soon tiring because of the constant strain; and thus better
sor occasional perusal. Like the faults of all great genium,
they are dangerous as models for inferior or for immature
minds.

131. Sic quoque. even (being) thu& even as. he is. Comp.
ἓ 121. iam robustis, by those who are now (already) mature ,-
well established in the true principles of style. Comp. ,S 57.
