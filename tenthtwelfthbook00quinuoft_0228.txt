practice of speaking constantly in connection with writing. οι
concurrit, the mouth comes toyetlzer ‚· is closed ‚· loses its sacility
of utterance. naturali—mobilitate animi. The mind must
be naturally quick of movement that can express properly
what is to be said on the instant (proxima), and at the same
time be shaping (struere) what is further on. provisa et for-
mata cogitatio, thought antieipated and molded, is a fuller
expression of struere ulteriora. vocem—excipiat, may be
ready for our voice, or utteranee.

not enough for the manifold or complicated task (officium) ot
the extemporary speaker; he must also possess as a second

from the remaining or latter part os his subject matter (ez
ultimo), just so much as he is momentarily expending in de-
livery. brevia, concisa, short, broken phrases ‚· indicating
unreadiness.

11-14. Third. Hence the necessity ot a mechanieal or unreasom'na
(inrationalis) habit ; the Greek ἄλογος τριβή.

11. flexus, transitus. The action of the eye itsels in read·
