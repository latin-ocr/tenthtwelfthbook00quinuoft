This work is designed as a text-book for the
use of students in Universities and Colleges, and
also to furnish an account of this branch of
archaeological study for general readers. It has
been prepared in the belief that a knowledge of
‘epigraphy forms an essential part of the equip-
ment of a teacher of the classics, and that the sub-
ject itself has become so important as to justify
its introduction‚ in elementary form at least, into
the curriculum of undergraduate studies.

A distinctive feature of the book is the num-
ber and character of its illustrations,—there being
over seven hundred cuts and diagrams οἱ inscrip-
tions, for the purpose of illustrating the text, and
for practice in reading. Of these, over one ι
hundred are photographic reproductions, showing
the forms of the letters and the arrangement of
the inscriptions. The work is also supplied with
an exhaustive bibliography and valuable tables of
abbreviations, archaisms‚ etc.

Copies sent, prepaid, on recez’lfit os the price.
