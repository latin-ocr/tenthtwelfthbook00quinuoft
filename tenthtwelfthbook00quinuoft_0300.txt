HIS grammar states the essential facts and principles of
the Greek language in concise form, with only so much
discussion as may reasonably be demanded for a clear

understanding of the subject. It therefore meets 'the wants
of secondary schools and at the safne time is sufficient for all
ordinary demands of the college course. The book incorpor-
ates the results of the more recent philological studies, and
includes many departures froin conventional presentation.
Due regard is paid to the fact that analogy plays an important
part in language, and that the context is often more important
than grammatieal rules in determining the exact significance of
mode or tense. The treatment of cases is thoroughly logical
and clear. The true genitive and the ablative genitive are dis-
tinguished from each other and considered separately; like-
wise the true dative, the locative dative, and the instrumental
dative. In this way much confusion is avoided.

The general rules of agreement are first given in a prelim-
inary paragraph and are then followed by a general statement
regarding attraction and constructio ad sensum, and its appli-
cation to substantives, adjectives, verbs, etc. The general
significance of each mode is summarized briefly at the begin-
ning, with its uses grouped and treated under the head of
statements, questions, wishes, commands, etc. The various
forms of statement are taken up and contrasted, thus allowing
the student to perceive at a glance their similarities and differ-
ences. - The subject of indirect discourse is put at the end of
syntax, and the principles have been fully stated in* their
proper places. The general principles are clearly enunciated‚
followed by the details with numerous examples. Tables of
syntactieal usage for reference are included to make it possible
for the pupil to perceive the normal usage at a glauce.
