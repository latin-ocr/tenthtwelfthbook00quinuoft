brief,- as opposed to the notice of all writers individually.
Comp. 3, 9. What the substance or gist of this opim‘on is, he
gives in the following statement introduced by enim. vetus-
tatem pertulerunt, have stood the test of time ‚· waeived am-
tiquity, or the past. vetustissimam Quintilian has in mind
here the writers and orators 01 the period from about Β. c. 200

to 120. of these Cicero in the Brutus singles out especially
Cato (Brut. 15, 61, sqq.) and Gaius Gracchus (33, 125). But in

general Quintilian uses veteres and antiqui of the times of Cice-
ro himself as well as his predecessors, and novi os those of the
post- -Augustan period. See ii, 5, 23.

41. quotus enim quisque, etc, for how rar-ely cam cm
author be fmmd 80 destitute of common seme as ml to have
hoped sor the memor-y of future time-3 with even the &malleat wn-
fidence at least in some portion (of his writings). Almost every
author must have had judgment enough not to have published
a book without the consciousness that there was something in it
worth reading, at least here and there. fiducia is the reason
or ground of speraverit. partis is an objective genitive after
fiducia. detrimento, loss, or eost ,· an ablativo of price.

42. protinus, at once, as α matter of comme, neceasaaily.

facere, 3, 3, and usum facere, 3, 28.

43-45. Preliminary to the proposed sketch ot typical authors a
word must be said about the different opinions or tastes ot orators and
critice on the several schools and styles ot eloquenoe3 especially ot the
preJudices ot some who stand opposed to each other as the admirer-s
respectively ot the old writers (veteres) and the model-ns (nom'), and ot
the dinei-enee in taste and genius which leads even those (ipsi) who ap-
prove the best type ot eloquenoe (rectum dicendi genu-3) to adopt only
one ot the three kinds into which it is divided. ‘

43. veteres; here in the sense mentioned in note on ἓ 40.
recens haee lascivia deliciaeqiie, this meretricioue wnd sq»-
pieh style of our oum day. See Introduction, p. 2ος and on lae-
cimas, ἓ 88.

44. ipsorum qui—volunt. Those who are partisans nei·
ther ot the veteres nor of the novi, but seek to attain that true
standard of eloquence which finds some examples in all periods.
