Pamcipnus ΤΟ ommi· THE ADVOCATE IN URDERTAKING cAusns.

1-7. There are sometimes cases which require the orator ω take upon
himself the part of accuser or prosecutor, though in general it is more
honorable to appear on the side of the defense3 and as lt is impossible
tor one advocate alone to speak for all defendants, we must choose from
those who solicit our aid such litigante as are commended ω us either by
respectable friends or by their own personal merits; making, however,
no discrimination between the weak and the powerful from impr-oper
motIves3 but even atter taking up‘a case, it should be abandoned it
round on investigation (inter discendum) to be unjustz and to do this, in-
deed, is tor the best interest of the client hImsem who ls not worthy ot
an advocate (patroni) it he does not follow his counsel.

1. facere (reos), to prosecute, arraiyn. horrebit; with ac-
cusative, as perhorresco, in 11, 9. ad reddendam rationem
vitae, to yive an account of his conduct. Often there are eir-
cumstances under which it is incumbent on the Roman orator,
eit-her as a duty to the state or to individual citizens (publicum,
privatum officium) to call to account, or prosecute before the
public tribunals men charged with crime against the republic
or against persons.

2. sociorum. The complaints of allies or provincials against ·
oppressive governors were brought before the senate and the
courts at Rome by Roman orators; as, for instance, those of
the Macedonians against Dolabella by Caesar, and those of the
Sicilians against Verres by Cicero ; and, in the time of Quintil-
ian, the charges of the province of Baetica against Baebius
Massa by Pliny the Younger and Herennius Senecio. See on

3. accusatoriam vitam vivere. Nothing was more odi-
ous in the estimation ot the Romans than to make a business os
prosecution3 a practice which became very common under the
more despotic emperors. Tacitus, the younger Pliny, and Ju-
venal have handed down the namoe os Regulus, Catullus Mes-
salinus, Oarus Metius, and the above-mentioned Massa Baebius,
as the most infamous accusers or delatores under Nero and
Domitian. See Tacit. Agr. 45, Plin. Ep. 1, 5, 4, 22, ’7, 33, J uv-
