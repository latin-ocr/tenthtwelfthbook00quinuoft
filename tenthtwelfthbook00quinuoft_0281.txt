ever attainments or processes in speech-making do not involve
the form of expression. rationem eloquendi, mode os ecc-

upsilon, Τ, represented by the Latin y, as in cymba, was prob-
ably the same in sound as the French u or the German ἃ.
comonantem; φ.

28. quae, etc„ which (letters), is they be written (or repre-
seneca) by our lettera (s and u), will produce a sort of dull and
baa-barone «sound. The soft Greek letters transformed into these
two Latin letters, will be supplanted, as it were (velut), by dis-

inverted F (Ἰ) to represent this sound of the Latin v, but it was
soon laid aside. See i, 7, 26; Tacit. A. 11, 14. nos persequi-
