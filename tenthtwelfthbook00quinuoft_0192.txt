this. Bassus Aufidius; an eminent historiari and orator,
contemporary with Servilius. Besides the history of the Ger·
man war, here referred to, he wrote a history of the civil wars.
Pliny the Elder took up the latter at the point where Aufidius
left it at his death. See Pl. Ep. 3, 5, 6. praestitit, agfforded,
illustrated. genere ipso; in his kind (of writing) as a kind,-
in his style generally, or on the whole ,· as contrasted with the
occasional exceptions immediately mentioned. Comp. ix, 2, 44.
suis viribus minor, less than (inferior to) his own abilitiea

104. superest adhuc vir, etc„ there is a man still living
wnd adominy, ete. The historian here referred to is probably
Fabius Rusticus, praised by Tacitus (Agr. 10) as eloquentissimus
recentium, and repeatedly quoted in t-he ‘⁶ Annals.'' The his-
torical work of Fabius came down, at least, to the end of the
reign of Nero, possibly later, and, therefore, must have been
published some time after A. D. 68. And though we know noth-
ing of the date either of his birth or death, he may very well
have been living at an advanced age when Quintilian was writ-
ing this passage, about A. D. 93, and when the expression “still
living ’³ or ‘⁶ surviving‚'' naturally suggestive of some one outliv-
ing the average of life, would be properly applied to him. The
qualities denoted by the terms libertas (independeme of thought
and word), elatum spiritum (elevated tone), audaces senten-
tias (bold oriyinality of lanyuaye), are not unlikely to have been

characteristic of one who was an intimate friend of Seneca
