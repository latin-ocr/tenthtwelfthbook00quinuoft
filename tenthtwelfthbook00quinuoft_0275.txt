2. haec operum genera; these classes of work-s, or pro-
ductione ‚· whether of oratory, painting‚ or statuary. auctores
here includes both masters of eloquence and of statuary and
painting; belom ξ 3, the word is used of painters alone. Comp.
the sense of it in x, 2, 15. ideo. Our author thinks that diver-
sity os ideas and tastes in oratory and all other arts, added to
the influences of time and place, has prevented them from
progressing in any uniform and fixed direction, and that on
thia account eloquence has not yet attained to perfection, nor,

as he is inclined to believe (ne-seio am), has any of the arts yet ¹

been perfected for the same reason.

In the following examples of great painters and sculptors
theinfiuence of time and of individual gifts‚ tasteS, and aims
(iudicio cuiusque atque proposito) in giving various directions
to art is clearly indicated. Zeuxis and Parrhasius, sor example,
both carry painting iar beyond its development under- Polygno-
tus and Aglaophon (plurimum arti addiderunt„ but their
works were speczfically different. So in the instance of Phidias
and Polyclitus among the sculptors. To make this parallelism
between fine art and eloquence complete, Quintilian, perhaps,
should not only have mentioned, as he has done, the typical
masters of painting and sculpture whose works. show the in-
fluence of their age, and also of their individual or special ten-
dencies, but he should have pointed out distinctly the charac-
teristics of qeneral schools or classes (genera) of art-production‚
such as the Sicyonian, or Peloponnesian‚ the Attic, and the
Rhodian. In the other part of the comparison, that is, in
oratory, which follows, the most conspicuous yenera or schools,
the Attio, the Asian, and Rhodiam, are described. As to the
three general kinds of oratorical style technically ter-med ymera
dicendi (ἓ 58), they do not enter into this comparison with
painting and sculpture, but are spoken of below in g 58, sqq.

3. Aglaophon. There were two painters of this name,
one the father and the other a nephew of Polygnotus. Quin-
tilian must have the former in mind; but why he mentions
Polygnotus first can not be accounted for. Spalding surmises
that the name may have been substituted in some way sor that
