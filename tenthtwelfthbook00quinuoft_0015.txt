doubtful authority, that the father of Quintilian was a
successful orator and teacher of rhetoric. At an early
age Quintilian accompanied his father to Rome, and was
placed under the charge of Domitius Afer,* a native of
Gaul. Afer was one of the most eminent-of the Roman
orators or advocates then living, and was far advanced
in life. After the death of Afer, which took place about
A. D. 60, Quintilian returned to Calagurris, and com-

teacher of rhetoric or forensic oratory. It was then that
his reputation and singular merit attracted the notice of
Galba, who was at that time Grovernor of Hispania Tar-
raconensis, and who soon afterward, on his accession to
the imperial throne (A. D. 68), invited the young and
brilliant orator to accompany him to Rome. Quintilian
entered the city in the train of the new emperor, and
henceforth made Rome his permanent abode. He at
once gained applause both as an advocate and lecturer.'
His success and his fame were unexampled. Students

to receive his instructions, The first year of Quin-
tilian’s residence in Rome was marked by a rapid series
of political revolutions‚ terminating in the overthrow of
Vitellius, and the rise of Vespasian and the Flavian
family· We now hear, for the first time in the history
of Roman education, of government patronage extended
on a general and systematic plan to teachers and men of
letters. Vespasian‚ though himself illiterate, convinced
of the importance of* encouraging education through-
out the vast dominions which had fallen under his sway,
established annual salaries for the support of Greek and
Roman rhetoricians and grammarians.† Quintilian was
the first to whom such a pension was assigned.

Twenty years were thus devoted, under the happioet
auspices, to the instruction of youth and to the duties of
