nores. XII, 8, 4-7. 263

ceited declaimers in x, 7, 21, presume to make their speeches at
once on the bare statement of the case. mentiti, falsely pre-
tendiny. multa et diserte, with cum decantaverunt, when
they have sung] through their mamy strains oend (these) in gyran-
diloquent style. clamoribus, skauta of applause. reducuntur;
the regular word denoting “to escort home.” As Cic. de Se-
nect. 63.

4. delicias. Here, as in x, 3, 18, the sels-indulgence of em-
ploying assistants or agents for doing the unpleasant drudgery
connected with the preparing os speeches is called a luxury.
doceri=discere causam. doceant3 sc. ipsum patronum vel
oratorem. media. litium manus, intemediate moenaqer of
suits. cum dicturis—sint, whereas (forsooth), to the speakers
(dictur-ie) themselves their oum pleadinye are not of 8⁰ much
importamce ,· namely, as to induce them to give personal atten-
tion to the study of the case. How can a second person be
expected to bestow his labor upon cases which are not his own
(in alienas actiones), if the advocate who has charge of them
and is responsible for them is himself too fastidious to do this
work!

5. libellis, bride ,· documents containing the essential
points. advocatorum, astomeys: 111 the sense of helpers of
the barrister, or orator. deinde, then, nevertheleeoe as in x, 1,
127, where the particle introduces something absurdly incon-
sistent with the fact or action preceding. declinandum, to be
evaded.

6. consilium, colores—custodiunt. These attomeys, not
content to state the naked facts (omnia uti qesta aunt), intro-
duce into their briefs some line of argument (coneiliwm) of their
own, and their own interpretation or coloring of the facts3 and
these ideas and interpretatione of mere attorneys most orators
adopt as their own, following them as scrupulously in making
their speeches in court, as boy declaimers in the schools stick to
the themes (themata) shaped out for them in form and phrase
by their instructorS. aliqua peiora.. In their infelicitous at-
tempts to cover up, evade, modify, these assistant attorneys in-
troduce things more hurtful to the case than the plain facts
themselves (veris) which they dcem disadvantageous to it.

⁵7. fis quonam—erim that is, to the clients. liberum
