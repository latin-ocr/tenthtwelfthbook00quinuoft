Lucilius a speeies of satire, invented by Ennius, and consisting
of different kinds ot verses. But, later, Terentius Varro (of
Reate, Β. c. 116-27) composed (condidit) satires, styled Menip-

of this kind were called iambi, though Archilochus, as well as
others, employed also other met-ers, and the iambic dimeter as
well as the trimeter. Horace’s seventeenth epode is an example
