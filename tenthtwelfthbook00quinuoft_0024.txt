was set off with the stilted and foppish rhetoric of the
schools. Susceptibility of quotation was the test of ex-
cellence. The youth pursuing his literary studies at
Rome eagerly caught up “fine sentences ” from popular
orators and lecturers. He wished to carry home some-
thing brilliant and deserving of memory. Such things
as pleased his fancy he often transmitted to his friends
in the colonies and provinces* This demand the speak-

Thus, at the time of Quintilian's final settlement in
Rome, he found every department of letters pervaded
with all possible enormities of corrupted taste. Seneca
had taught the philosopher to declaim in moral essays,
Valerius had declaimed in historica] anecdotffl, and Lu·
can in epic poetry. Even natural history and geogra-
phy were composed in the declamatory vein. Every
writer sought to appear ingenious, keen, and oracular.

Fortunately for Quintilian, in his attempt at reform,
he was not compelled to encounter the living influence
of Seneca. The tragic death of that eminent philoso-
pher had occurred several years before. Another cir-
cumstance which favored Quintilian was the marked
change in the tone of feeling and in the habits of the
Romans, brought about by the accession of the Flavian
family to the empire. The people were sobered, and
social life was less ostentatious and artificial. A cor-
rected judgment in respect to the fashions of society
might be expected to heed the teachings of sound criti·
cism in letters, Thus Quintilian, superior as he was in
gifts and attainments to most of the literary men then
living, surrounded by a multitude of devoted pupils
