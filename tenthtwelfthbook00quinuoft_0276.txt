painter. simplex color, simple colorin9,· not referring to
“monochrome” painting, but to the use of few and decided
colors. proprio quodam intellegendi ambitu3 freely ren-
dered: throuqh a desire of the reputation of peculiar insiyht,
or by an affectation of superior judqment. proprio seems to
be used by enallage here for proprie qualifying intellegendi.
ambitu is not usual in this sense; hence quodam. See on

proper treatment. examinasse—lineas, to have made a more
critical stady of lines, refers to the contours of figures as seen
by the eye in Nature, and skillfully imitated in the painting of
Parrhasius. In the words of Pliny (35, 10, 67), haec est picturae
summa subtilitas. The outline of a figure, he adds, ought to
seem rounded and to vanish in such a way as to promise some—
thing more behind it, and to suggest even what it hides. This
is not the same as the quality of correct drawinq (conscribere)
mentioned below.

. 5. plus dedit; i. e., gave more fulness, or larger propor—
tions than Nature. Pliny (Hist. Nat. 35, 10, 64) says that
Zeuxis was criticised for exaggerating the head and members
of his figures. Quintilian, who seems in the whole of this com-
parison to have in mind either the remarks of Pliny on the two-
painters or those of some common authority, must mean that
Zeuxis, while giving more attention to the light and shade ot
suofaces, or as Pliny expresses it, corpora et media rerum, as
distinguished from the delicate contours and the faultless draw-
ing of Parrhasius, also gave to the body and its parts an ap-
pearance of greater size. id, this representation ,· this type, or

to the drawing of Parrhasius, not to the delicacy or thinness of
his vanishing outlines. His figures, drawn in pencil or crayon,
were perfect in form and proportion; so that in this regard he
was the'·‘ law-givet ’' in wanting, like Polyclitus in sculpture.
