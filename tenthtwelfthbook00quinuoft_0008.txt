4 PREFAGE ΤΟ ΤΗΕ SECOND EDITION.

The notes on both books in this second. edition
have been greatly amplified, and no labor has
been spared to make them helpful wherever help
seemed to be needed.

I take this opportunity to express my grateful
acknowledgments to Professor E. P. Orowell, of
Amherst College, and to my eolleague, Professor
Elisha J ones, for much aid and many very im-
portant suggestions.
